## 
## We are going to write and run the canonical "Hello, World!" program. In
## Python, this involves creating a text file with a .py extension, writing
## the code for our program in that file, and then running that file with the
## Python interpreter.
##
##=============================================================================
## Hello, World!
##=============================================================================
##
## Create a file in the presentation folder called 'my_hello_world.py'. You can
## do this with Notepad, IDLE, or any other text editor. Open that file and put
## the following code:

print("Hello, world!")

## ... in the file, and save it. The print() function outputs whatever statement
## you put in. If you're feeling adventurous, you can assign a variable or
## mess with the string. Save the file.
##
## So now we have our source code saved, we need to run it. In Python we can
## run a particular Python program by running the Python executable followed by
## a space, and then path of your Python program as the first argument.
## This would look like:
##
##     python.exe ~/Desktop/201_intro_for_devs_part_1/my_hello_world.py
##
## If the above command doesn't yield the correct result, make sure that Python
## is on your PATH. If not, you may have to proivde the absolute path of the
## Python executable. If it still doesn't work, check to make sure you've
## actually saved the file in the right place. If it still doesn't work, you
## should bug me as I have probably overlooked something.
##
## Congratulations, you have created and run a Python program! You're more than
## welcome to use the command line going forward, however for the sake of
## convenience we are going to continue to use the scratch file.
