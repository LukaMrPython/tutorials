NAME      : Python Intro for Newbies

===
Generally
===
This is a presentation intended to provide an introduction to the Python
language for people without a background in computer science. It is made up 
entirely of Python source files, and contains 6 main sections:

1) "What is this?"
    Provides an introduction into what we will do in the presentation.

2) "How does Python work?"
    Provides an overview of what Python is and how it is used.

3) "How do I code?"
    Provides background on how Python programs can be written and run.

4) "What are the basics?"
    Provides a high-level overview of some of Python's features.

5) "Where do I go from here?"
    Provides resources and advice for continuing Python education.

6) "Exercises"
    Provides a series of quick exercises for filling time if need be.

===
Requirements
===
This presentation is intended to be stepped through in an interactive manner.
This requires the use of a Python interpreter and IDLE. These items are
included in the base Python installer here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

DO NOT INSTALL LEGACY PYTHON (I.E. ANY VERSION OF PYTHON STARTING WITH A
2). IT IS OUTDATED AND IT WILL BREAK THINGS.

Alternatively they can be installed through your organization's software 
installation process. Note: if you are installing the software, check the
"Add Python to Path" option in the installer.

This has only been tested with Microsoft Windows 10 and Python 3.7.0.

===
Setup
===
For the sake of simplicity, move the folder for this presentation to your
"Desktop" folder. If necessary, unzip the files. Go your Start Menu and
select "IDLE". A window should pop up that says "Python 3.7.0 Shell".
Go to the "File Menu", and then navigate to your desktop and the
presentation folder. Open "_1_what_is_this.py". Then repeat the process
and open the file called "scratch.py".

Put the "Shell" window in the upper right hand corner of your screen;
put the "scratch" window in the lower right hand corner of your screen;
put the "_1_what_is_this.py" on the left hand side of your screen. You
are now ready to go.
