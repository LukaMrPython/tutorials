## ============================================================================
## Hello, world!
## ============================================================================
##
## See also:
##     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program
##
## As you may be aware, by tradition the first computer program you write will
## be "Hello, world!". In this program, you simply have the computer print the
## phrase "Hello, world!". It is not a very useful program, but it requires
## you build an executable program from scratch (which by extension means you
## have a working environment to execute this program).
##
## So to do this, you will go to the "File" menu and select "New File". This
## will automatically give your file the .py extension (but if you're doing
## this in a simple text editor, you'll need to remember to add the .py
## suffix yourself.
##
## Then put the following in your file before saving it to "hello_world.py".

print('Hello, world!')

## Which basically tells Python, "Hey, Python! Please print this thing to the
## terminal so I can read it!".
##
## You can run this with F5, but for the sake of practice try doing this via
## the command line by changing your working directory to the presentation
## folder via:
##
##    cd ~/Desktop/101_intro_for_newbies
##
## Then, once you are in the folder, you can run:
##
##    python hello_world.py
##
## As we have previously mentioned, passing a single file argument to Python
## tells Python to run the program contained in that file. Consequently, your
## interpreter should output:
##
##    Hello, World!
##
## Note: Python will not output the quotation marks from your code unless
## specifically instructed to do so.
##
## For bonus points, you can do this in Notepad instead.
##
## ============================================================================
## So, that's it?
## ============================================================================
##
## Yes and no.
##
## You now have the rudimentary knowledge required to create and run Python
## programs. That said, I'm hoping you aspire to do more than print "Hello,
## world!" to your console. Python is a powerful and expansive language, and
## you can spend an entire career learning more about it.
##
## The next section endeavors to give you a super-duper-high-level overview of
## how you can get started with Python. See the "_5_where_do_i_go_from_here.py"
## for additional detail.
