## Step 0: WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!
## ============================================================================
##
## If you are using Python within a company or organization, it is incumbent
## upon you to comply with development and information security policies. As a
## newbie, you are likely unfamiliar with many of the rules in place for
## software development and you should take care not to violate them.
##
## ============================================================================
## Step 1: Download and Network
## ============================================================================
##

##    https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
##
## Go home and download the latest version of Python today (get a version of 
## Python starting with 3 (e.g. 3.7.0) not 2 (e.g. 2.7.10). You can also pick up
## the latest version of Visual Studio Code. Both are free of cost for Windows,
## Linux, and Mac OS. Python is one of those things you really only learn by
## doing. So get out there, start some toy projects and write some code.
##
## ============================================================================
## Step 2: Learn the Language
## ============================================================================
##
## See also:
##     https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
##
## Python also has a really strong tutorial for people getting started. It will
## take you a while to get all the way through it, but it is well worth it.
##
## See also:
##     https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
##
## Take a few days to click through and use the Python Standard Library too.
## If you think something is worth doing, someone has probably already done it.
## It has modules for pretty much everything.
##
## See also:
##     https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/
##
## There are also a bajillion and a half online tutorials of varying quality.
## I am partial to "Learn Python the Hard Way".
##
## ============================================================================
## Step 3: Give Back
## ============================================================================
##
## As much as anything else, Python succeeds because people genuinely love the
## language and want to help other people. Help. Teach. Evangelize. Life is too
## short to be a jerk.
##
## See also:
##     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model
##
## You can also give back by getting involved with open-source projects on your
## own time. Get involved! There are a multitude of projects out there that need
## coders.
