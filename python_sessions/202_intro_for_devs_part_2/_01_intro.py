##=============================================================================
## Generally
##=============================================================================
##
## This presentation is a continuation of what we covered in our previous
## presentation, Python 201 for Devs. Previously we built a base of general
## knowledge of Python grammar. Here, we arere going to look at some of the
## things you will need to build out significant programs.
##
## Same as before, this presentation is going to be conducted from within IDLE,
## which is Python's text editor. It is not particularly good or feature-rich,
## but it is installed by default with Python (which is why we are using it).
##
## The links you see are with taking a look at. Many of them cover these topics
## better than I can. The first of these I would point you to is the official
## Python 3 tutorial:
##
## https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
##
## As a reminder, you will want to put the code we are going over on the left
## side of your screen. Then put the "Shell" window in the top right hand
## corner, and open the "scratch" file and put it in the lower right hand
## corner. Then to make sure everything is working, copy paste this in the
## "scratch" window and run it (either via the Run Menu, or F5).

import random

scifi_heroines = ['Alyx Vance', 'Katniss Everdeen', 'Ellen Ripley']
choice = random.choice(scifi_heroines)

print(f'My favorite scifi heroine is {choice}!')

## If it does not work, something has gone horribly, horribly wrong.
##
## Stop me if you have questions. Especially for stupid questions. If
## you have a question, odds are others do too. Stop me if you have suggestions
## for how to improve things. Without feedback I am flying blind.
