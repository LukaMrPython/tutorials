===
Requirements
===
This presentation is intended to be stepped through in an interactive manner.
This requires the use of a Python interpreter and IDLE. These items are
included in the base Python installer here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

DO NOT INSTALL LEGACY PYTHON (I.E. ANY VERSION OF PYTHON STARTING WITH A
2). IT WILL BREAK THINGS AND REACHES ITS END OF LIFE ON JANUARY 1, 2020.

Alternatively they can be installed through your organization's software 
installation process. Note: if you are installing the software, check the
"Add Python to Path" option in the installer.

This has only been tested with Microsoft Windows 10 and Python 3.7.0.

===
Setup
===
For the sake of simplicity, move the folder for this presentation to your
"Desktop" folder. If necessary, unzip the files. Go your Start Menu and
select "IDLE". A window should pop up that says "Python 3.7.0 Shell".
Go to the "File Menu", and then navigate to your desktop and the presentation
folder. Open "_01_intro.py". Then repeat the process and open the file called
"scratch.py".

Put the "Shell" window in the upper right hand corner of your screen; put
the "scratch" window in the lower right hand corner of your screen; put the
"_01_intro.py" on the left hand side of your screen. You are now ready to go.
