MIT-licensed tutorials related to Python and Python data analysis

Video walkthroughs of these tutorials and the manner in which they are set up are being made available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0K68QsPLDasgvcTuDnNCF5JX21o2YX67)

This repository contains the following Python tutorials that require only Python:

    * 201: Intro for Devs Part 1
    * 202: Intro for Devs Part 2

It also contains the following Python data analysis tutorials that are presented via the Jupyter Notebook and a variety of other Python packages (most easily obtained via the Anaconda3 distribution [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)):

* **Journeys in Jupyter**
    * 101: Python Data Ecosystem
    * 201: Cleaning Data
    * 202: Automation Basics
    * 203: Machine Learning Basics

See "!README.txt" in the presentation folders for details on how to set up your Python environment to follow along with these tutorials. Most of that can be summarized by: 1) download Python and/or Anaconda; 2) put the presentation folder on your desktop; and, 3) open the introductory notebook or Python module.
