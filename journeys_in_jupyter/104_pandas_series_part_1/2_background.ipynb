    "In the early 2000s Python didn't really have a general-purpose library for data manipulation. If you wanted a free, intuitive interface for data analysis, you had to use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)\">R programming language</a>. That changed in 2008 with the introduction of the [Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_%28software%29) data analysis library.\n",
    "\n",
    "While working at a quantitative finance firm, an individual named Wes McKinney built an econometrics platform for analyzing panel data (**PAN**el **DA**ta -> Pandas). This platform used [Numpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\">Python</a> as its base, but adopted many of R's concepts for effectively transforming datasets. It has since become the *de facto* standard in the Python community for high-level data analysis.\n",

    "If you downloaded Anaconda, you've already got pandas. If not, you can get it by downloading the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), or by using [Pip/PyPI](https://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html).\n",

Nothing else really compares in the Python space (or arguably anywhere else). Most operations worth doing can be done in pandas.\n",
