If you wanted a free, intuitive interface for data analysis, you had to use the [R language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). That changed in 2008 with the introduction of the [Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_%28software%29) data analysis library.\n",

This platform used [Numpy]() and [Python]() as its base, but adopted many of R's concepts for effectively transforming datasets. It has since become the *de facto* standard in the Python community for high-level data analysis.\n",
