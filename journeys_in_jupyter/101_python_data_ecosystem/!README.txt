NAME      : Introduction to the Python Data Ecosystem 

===
Generally
===
This presentation provides an introduction to the Jupyter Notebook (our 
user interface) and the other freely available Python data analysis tools 
out there. It is made up entirely of Jupyter Notebook files and is divided 
as follows:

1) "1_introduction"
    Pretty much like it sounds.

2) "2_jupyter"
    Getting familiar with our UI of choice. 

3) "3_python"
    The language underpinning it all. 

4) "4_matplotlib"
    For graphing and such.

5) "5_numpy"
    Making Python fast. 

6) "6_scipy"
    For statistics and other science-y stuff. 

7) "7_pandas"
    Say hello to your new best friend. 

8) "8_scikit_learn"
    Science is magic that works.  

9) "9_other"
    A little bit of everything else. 

===
Requirements
===
This presentation is intended to be stepped through in an interactive manner
under the guidance of an instructor. The presentation requires the Jupyter
Notebook and a variety of pacakges which can most easily be obtained here
for free:

https://www.anaconda.com/download

Anaconda is a Python distribution that comes prepackaged with a variety of
data analysis and automation software packages.

Alternatively they can be installed through 1) your organization's software 
installation or provisioning process; 2) your operating system's package manager (if applicable); or 3) the pip Python package manager.

This has only been tested with Microsoft Windows 10 and Anaconda3 version
5.2.0.

===
Setup
===
For the sake of simplicity, move the folder for this presentation to your
"Desktop" folder. If necessary, unzip the files. Go your Start Menu and
select Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda3 folder. Select "Microsoft Edge"
if necessary.

When the browser window opens, navigate to the presentation folder on your
desktop and click "1_introduction". This will begin your Jupyter Notebook
session (during which you can enter Escape + H or the Menu for help). Cells
can be executed using Shift + Enter.
